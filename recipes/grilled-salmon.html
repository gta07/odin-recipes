    <p>My family eats lots of seafood, and salmon is 
        one of our favorites. This is a quick and 
        delicious recipe that will have a meal prepared 
        in minutes! If you like heat, you may add red 
        crushed peppers or a dash of cayenne!</p>
    <p>You will have to need the following ingridients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds salmon fillet</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Directions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine olive oil, lemon juice, green onions, parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder in a small bowl. Set aside 1/4 cup of the marinade. Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the remaining marinade over the top. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Remove the salmon and discard the used marinade.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Place salmon on the preheated grill skin side down. Cook, basting occasionally with the reserved marinade, until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
